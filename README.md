# Loudspeaker-Personal-Projects

I started researching and learning about loudspeaker design in 2018 through library and online content.  
In 2019 I built my first design for a 12-inch closed subwoofer.  In this project I had to design a speaker cabinet with the proper dimensions and followed other acoustic principles to get the ideal internal volume and shape. I utilized my carpentry skills to professionally construct the speaker cabinet.  
In 2020 I built a 3 driver, passive crossover ported loudspeaker.  I used my knowledge of analog electronics to design low and high pass filters and frequency notching circuits. While testing the cross over I discovered problems with my initial design.  Following the engineering method, I redesigned the circuitry and produce an even sound.  I used my carpentry skills to create a speaker cabinet that is approximately 48” x 16” x 15”.  
In the future I hope build an active crossover and expand my knowledge of acoustics, circuitry, and engineering practices.
